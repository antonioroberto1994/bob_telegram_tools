# Use a bot

In order to use a Bot in your code create a TelegramBot object.  `<your_token>` represents the API token generated by the [BotFather](https://t.me/botfather) and `<your_chat_id>` is your unique identifier that you can find through the [**@chatid_echo_bot**](https://t.me/chatid_echo_bot).

```python
from bob_telegram_tools.bot import TelegramBot

token = '<your_token>'
user_id = int('<your_chat_id>')
bot = TelegramBot(token, user_id)
```

!!! warning
    You have to start a coversation with your bot before it is able to send you a message!

Once you have created your Bot you can send a message and update it without send a notification through the returned reference.

```python
sent_message = bot.send_text('Hello TelegramBot!')
bot.update_text(sent_message,'Updated hello TelegramBot!')
```
